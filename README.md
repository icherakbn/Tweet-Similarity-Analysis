# Tweet-Similarity-Analysis
Tweet Similarity Analysis with Transformer Embeddings

# Overview
This project aims to develop a model for analyzing the semantic similarity of tweets and providing a similarity score indicating the likelihood that they were authored by the same user. The model utilizes transformer-based architectures for text representation and distance calculations.

# Features
Tokenization of tweets using DistilBERT tokenizer.
Siamese model architecture for tweet similarity analysis.
Training and evaluation pipelines for model development.
# Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
Transformers library (Hugging Face)
Pandas
NumPy
scikit-learn
